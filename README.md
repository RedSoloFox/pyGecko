# pyGecko
Python library for use with TCPGecko. Requires kernel exploit to use.

**Files:**

tcpgecko.py is the actual library, can use just it in IDLE (only tested on python 2)

common.py is another library to make things easier to work with.

**Usage:**

Create a TCPGecko object and either pass and ip in on init, or use the connect() method to connect via an IP in string form.
