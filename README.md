# pyGecko
Python library for use with TCPGecko. Requires kernel exploit to use.

**Files:**

tcpgecko.py is the actual library, can use just it in IDLE (only tested on python 2)

common.py is another library to make things easier to work with.

**Usage:**

>from pygecko import TCPGecko

Either:

>my_gecko = TCPGecko()

Or:

>my_gecko = TCPGecko("my.ip.goes.here")  # Auto Connects

**Credits:**

Python library: NWPlayer123
